## Problem Statement

The Learning Management System is for any learner or teacher which will replace 
existing conventional methods of chalk and board style of learning. The new system 
will control the following information: store the instructional materials , books , 
videos , and control information and various other educational resources, which will 
be organized by category. These services are to be provided in an effective manner, 
with the goal of giving and receiving simpler, prolific, and productive learning.

## Objectives 
The Learning Management System is designed to replace existing conventional 
methods of chalk and board style of learning. A Learning Management System 
(LMS) is software that automates the administration of teaching events. All 
Learning Management Systems manage the log-in of registered users, manage 
course catalogs, record data from learners, and provide reports to management.
However, most of the LMS in service have different characteristics and are mutually 
incompatible, hence, effective Learning Management System needs to be 
standardized thus, we are implementing LMS.
